Mars Curiosity Rover - In search of new opportunities - VS 2017

In search of new opportunities, European Space Agency has decided to open a station on Mars. In order to make sure that the proposed site is suitable we will first send a rover to get a complete view of the surrounding terrain.
The rover will accept 'WAD' input to control it: 'A' rotates the rover 90 degrees anti-clockwise, 'D' rotates it 90 degrees clockwise. 'W' makes the rover move forward one square. The Mars plateau is a 9x9 grid.
Your task is to create a program that represents the Mars plateau and the rover's movement across it.
 
Think about what kind of behavioural design pattern might be applicable here. How could we refactor the code if we decided to extend the rover to add an 'S' command to make it go backwards, how easy would that be?
